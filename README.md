# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2023

Your challenge is to generate actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data that corresponds to linemen performance on passing plays.

Participants will select one of three tracks in which to submit.

- Undergraduate track. This is open only to groups or individuals composed entirely of undergraduate students. Verification may be required to prove eligibility.

- Metric track. Create a metric to assess performance and/or strategy. This can be focused on offensive or defensive players, and on teams or individuals.

- Coaching presentation track. The goal of this track is to analyze and present data in a submission designed for coaches. We encourage participants interested in this track to partner with a coach (or current/former player), though that is not required.

All submissions must explicitly state which track they are submitting to. Participants may not submit to more than one track.
